## Summary
Hearthstone is a card/deck building video game made by Blizzard Entertainment. It is set in the Warcraft Universe (another game by Blizzard), Many of the cards being based on characters, spells, weapons and locations from Warcraft. It has a very large amount of collectible cards from the base game as well as multiple expansion packs.

The basic premise of Heathstone is a 1 vs 1 card game. You use your cards to attack the enemy and their cards. The first to deplete the enemy's health to zero wins. There are multiple different kinds of cards, like beasts or characters that attack and defend, or spells that do instant damage.

## Final Thoughts
Hearthstone is a very fun game that is very easy to play. With the amount of cards that it has there is a large variety of different ways to play, so it keeps the game feeling fresh. The only thing I really don't like is the speed of gameplay. Turn based games like Hearthstone can be a lot slower than action games, with having to wait for the other player to complete their turn before you can do anything. However, I still find it enjoyable overall, as it is a very strategic and challenging yet fun game.
