# Bungie Halo 3 testing.

## Steps:
1.	Basic Testing: Functional Testing (making sure all basic functions work), 11 thousand lines of test cases
2.	Integration Testing (Do new singleplayer features break multiplayer/vice versa)
3.	Balance testing (new weapons)
4.	Art loading, sounds working, etc.
5.	Usability Testing (Get inside playerâ€™s head, map out experience, how player feels)
6.	Playtesting (Multiple people have same issue? Needs to be fixed)
7.	Heatmaps for Multiplayer (Popular points on map)/Singleplayer (Frustrating points) maps
