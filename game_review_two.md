## Summary
Overwatch is a First Person Shooter game by Blizzard Entertainment. It has a diverse cast of characters to choose from, each with their own role, abilities, and design. While the game does not has, a Story mode, it has a large amount of story and lore given through other sources.

There are currently 30 Characters, or "Heroes" in Overwatch. One such character is Lena Oxton, known in the game as "Tracer". Tracer is a former member of the International Task Force "Overwatch" who was chosen to test a teleporting fighter jet. However, during her flight, the teleporter malfunctioned, and Tracer was desynchronised from the flow of time. She did not have physical form, and could disappear from existence for days at a time. Another member of Overwatch, Winston, a hyper-intelligent gorilla, created a chronal accellerator for Tracer, allowing her to regain physical form, and giving her control over her own time, giving her her in-game abilities of teleporting short distances, and rewinding her own time to heal. Each of the 30 heroes in overwatch has their own interesting backstory, some of which there is still much to discover for.

The backstory of Overwatch is that years prior to the game's point in time, there was a war between humans and omnics, a humanoid race of robots living among humans. An international task force known as Overwatch banded together to help end the war, and the members became legends. Years later, Overwatch was dispanded after the Swiss Overwatch Headquarters exploded during a UN investigation against the task force. The lore and story of the game's universe has been expanded on in many ways, including comics, animated shorts on the game's YouTube channel, in game seasonal events, and more. The game and lore is also still expanding, over 3 years after the game's initial release.

There are three different roles to choose from while playing the game, Tank, Damage, and Support. Tanks are generally on the front lines, soaking up damage, Damage are the main damage dealers, and Support are healers and buffers. A general good team composition is 2-2-2, 2 people in each role, as most games are 6v6. There are objectives like push or defend a payload, capture or defend multiple points, or capture and hold a single point.

## Final Thoughts
I've put many hours into Overwatch as it is a very fun and exciting game with many diffent ways to play. Each game is different, as there are many different team compositions and characters to choose from. Blizzard consistently comes up with new and interesting characters and maps that are extremely fun to play. I don't often find a class based FPS where I can have fun playing every class, but in Overwatch I can have fun with every single hero.

However, while Overwatch is consistent with releasing new characters and maps, they haven't introduced any new game modes for a while. So while each game is fun, the objectives are always the same, and limited. Many people, myself included, have wanted them to add a story mode to the game, as the outside story and lore is very in-depth and interesting. A Story mode would be an excellent way of continuing the story, but there has been nothing to even suggest that Blizzard are working on one.
