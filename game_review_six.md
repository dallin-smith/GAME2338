## Summary
Shark simulator is a small and simple game where you play as a shark. The goal of the game is essentially to cause mayhem. You can move around on land, and attack people and vehicles. By causing destruction you gain money, which allows you to buy cosmetics and weapons for your shark.

The game has objectives such as killing a certin amount of people, biting cars, and much more. It also has challenges you can do, like races. You have to do ll of this will trying to avoid dying from police. The more destruction you cause, the more they will attack you.

## Final Thoughts
Although this game has simple graphics and controls, it is still very fun. It is a very nice time-waster game that allows you to have some dumb, random fun. The only problem I have, is I think it would be nice to have more to do, such as another map to play on.
