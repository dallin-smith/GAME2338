## Summary
Tabletop Simulator is a simulation game made by Berserk Games. It allows you to simulate playing on an actual tabletop in an online game setting. There are many different built in games, such as chess, checkers, solitair, and even a whole RPG kit, to play games like Dungeons & Dragons online with friends without needing to be together physically. It is also open to community generated content through the Steam Workshop.

Many players have recreated real life board games in Tabletop Simulator. Games like Betreyal at House on the Hill, Monopoly, Sorry, Uno, and Much more. Anything can be created from dice based to card based games, and even custom maps for RPG games.

However, it is not limited there. Tabletop Simulater has a lot of room for open creativity, with games like tabletop mini-golf or bowling made by the community. It even has a feature to flip the table you're playing on to take out your frustration, while also including a handy "rewind time" button so no actual game progress is lost.

## Final Thoughts
Tabletop simulator is a fantastic way to play games with friends that you wouldn't normally be able to in an online video game setting. It is very fun, and virtually infinitely expandable. I've found it a great way to play board games with my cousins that we all enjoy.

I don't have too many criticisms for the game. If anything, I think it could improve on the controlls a little bit, especially when using a controller over Mouse & Keyboard. Overall, Tabletop Simulator is a fantastic game that I think pretty much everyone can enjoy.
