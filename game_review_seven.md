## Summary
Unturned is a cartooney zombie apocalypse game with the simple goal of surviving. It has a very simple art style, with very low intensive graphics. The characters are very blocky and simple looking, but the game does have character customization to vary it up a bit. Unturned has multiple maps you can play on, many of which named after/based around real world locations. There is also a level editor which you can use to build your own maps.

The game can be a little hard to learn, as there isn't really a solid tutorial, but it is very extensive. You can find guns, swords, axes, knives, and other weapons to fight the hoards of undead. You can also gather materials like wood to build structures and make weapons like bows. You can also explore the map to discover every detail, with cars, and even planes and helicopters to help you move. You can also deck out in different outfits which will increase your inventory capacity.

## Final Thoughts
Unturned is a very fun and interesting game. However, it can be realy difficult to just start out. You start with nothing, and in order to get any form of weapon or clothes, you have to go into towns, where there are item spawns. The problem is, there are so many zombies in the towns, you'll likely die before you get anything decent. So while the game is very fun to play, you will die, a lot.
