## Summary
Skyrim is the fifth installment of the Elder Scrolls series by Bethesda Game Studios. It is a fantasy game that takes place in the Province of Skyrim, homeland of the Nords in the continent of Tamriel. Skyrim encourages playing the game in the way you want to. You can easily switch from first person to third person perspective, as well as chose your character's appearance, armor, and weapons.

In Skyrim, you can choose the way you want your character to look, with a wide variety of options. You can choose from a variety of races, including multiple human races and elf races, as well as Orcs and anthropomorphic Cats and Lizards known as Kajiits and Argonians respectively. Each race also has a wide variety of options to edit their appearance, including hair style and color, eye shape and color, etc.

While playing the game, you discover that you are a being known as the Dragonborn, a person who is able to absorb the souls of dragons in order to harness their power. As Dragonborn, you are able to perform what are known as "shouts", magic emitted from your voice when speaking the dragon language. These shouts give you abilities such as breathing fire, running at inhuman speeds, controlling dragons, and much more.

Skyrim has a vast array of weapons and armor, allowing you to choose exactly how you want to play. There are multiple types of melee weapons, each with their own statistics, as well as bows, and magic abilites. Different armor types can also work better for a particular type of weapon, such as robes to increase magic abilities.

There is a huge amount of things to do in Skyrim, from exploring the world to completing quests to save it. There are hundreds of quests to do, ranging from small tasks to joining a guild who wants to kill the emporer. There are also hundreds of locations to discover, which can include large towns, or giant camps.

Skyrim is a large game, with many things to do and ways to play. It is a game that encourages doing whatever you want, and to have fun doing it. It is a very immersive and fun world to explore.

## Final Thoughts
Skyrim is a very fun and enjoyable game, that has nearly infinite replay value. I love being able to chose how you want to play, and every aspect of your character, from appearance to statistics. One thing that hurts Skyrim is the amount of bugs and exploits there are. You can easily clip through walls, and abuse the game's leveling system. However, I would argue that in a lot of ways, this adds a lot to the experience of the game. While it can take you out of the immersion of the game, it's fun to test the limits of the game and get to locations or items you were never intended to.
