## Summary
Stunt Rally is a Racing game with the ability to create custom tracks. These tracks can be customized with everything from the track itself to terrain. You can even edit what the track is made of to mess with the grip, some cars being better on different tracks than others.

The game also has different modes to play. There is a simple single race mode, Tutorials, Championships and Challenges. There is even a multiplayer mode, so you can play with more people.

## Final Thoughts
I have never personally enjoyed racing games, however with Stunt Rally it does help that it is very simple. It's a little hard to understand the track editor, but it does have a lot of customizabilty. It's not a game I would play often, but it is fun in some aspects.
